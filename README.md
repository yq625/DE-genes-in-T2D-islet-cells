# DE-genes-in-T2D-islet-cells
Pancreatic islet cells are important to maintain the normal blood glucose (sugar) levels, and those cells which produce glucagon (α cells) and insulin (β cells) play crucial roles in regulating the blood sugar levels. We found a list of data about RNA sequencing of single human islet cells, which includes the single-cell RNA sequences of α cells and β cells from people without and with type 2 diabetes(T2D). We aim to find differentially expressed genes (DE genes) in T2D patients’ islet cells. By using the Cufflinks package in Linux, we found 101 genes differ significantly in α cells and 135 genes in β cells between people with or without T2D. The error bar for each highly expressed gene is larger than our expectation which are caused by the large variance among single cell sequencing data. Additionally, we used packages edgeR and limma in R to analyze differentially expressed genes in T2D patients, too. The genes we found in α cells are TSG101, CPNE8, VMP1, DFFA, USP2, SLC35A4, POGLUT1 and in β cells are NNT-AS1, MZT1.
